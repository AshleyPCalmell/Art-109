    <p>Walking into the party you were hesitant to begin with.
   <div class="hidden-text" href="https://ashleypcalmell.github.io/Art-109/dom/index.html"> I mean the guy is not even really your friend, more like one of those acquaintances from class.</p></a></div></div>





    <p>This guy invited you to one of his big frat parties, and since you had the weekend off it seemed like a good chance to socialize. </p>
    <a href="https://ashleypcalmell.github.io/Art-109/dom/index.html">Walking in though you feel a bit anxious, are eyes all on you or are they just people scouting for a chance? Eyes linger while you walk through the door, trying to remain comfortable in this new area. In your discomfort, you need to make a decision.</a>
    <p> Grab a drink or Get a Capri Sun from the fridge
    </p>

    <h3>Grab a Drink</h3>
    <p>You walk up to what seems to be the considered the bar, decked out with a giant Gatorade cooler with a paper slapped in front reading “Chad’s secret jungle juice”. Though the writing is a bit crude you grab a red solo cup and pour your drink. You feel an arm wrap around your shoulder,<a href="https://ashleypcalmell.github.io/Art-109/dom/index.html"> seems you’ve made a new “friend”.</a></p>
