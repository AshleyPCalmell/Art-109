    <p>Walking into the party you were hesitant to begin with.</p>
    <p a> I mean the guy is not even really your friend, more like one of those acquaintances from class.</p>
    <p>This guy invited you to one of his big frat parties, and since you had the weekend off it seemed like a good chance to socialize. </p>
    <p>Walking in though you feel a bit anxious, are eyes all on you or are they just people scouting for a chance? Eyes linger while you walk through the door, trying to remain comfortable in this new area. In your discomfort, you need to make a decision.</p>
    <p> Grab a drink or Get a Capri Sun from the fridge
