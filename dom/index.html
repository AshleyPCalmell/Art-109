    <p class="visible-text">You walk up to what seems to be the considered the bar, decked out with a giant Gatorade cooler with a paper slapped in front reading “Chad’s secret jungle juice”. Though the writing is a bit crude you grab a red solo cup and pour your drink. You feel an arm wrap around your shoulder,</p> <p class="hidden-text"> seems you’ve made a new “friend”.</a></p></div>
<div class="container">
    <p class="visible-text">"HEY LEMME KNOW IF YOU LIKE THE DRINK, I’M CHAD!” You chuckle at the odds the creator would find you, but feel a bit more comfortable at the sight of a friendlier face. </p>
    <p class="hidden-text">Friendly might be a bit too nice, more like drunken happiness, Chad reeks of boos and has drinks spilled all over his shirt. Yet there are still people looking at him in awe</p>

    <p class="visible-text">You open the fridge and a blast of light highlights you in the dim kitchen. A girl sitting on the counter turns her head to you as you pull out a Capri sun. “OMG, you wanna do mixed drinks with Capri Suns? That’s genius!”</p><p class="hidden-text">Her high-pitched squeal draws the attention of the men around her,</p><p>and her posse comes over to you. The attention is nice, and you slowly get more comfortable with the group as you drink your mixed Capri Sun.</p>

    <p class="hidden-text">Luckily you watched them make it, so your anxiety is at ease.</p><p>You banter with the girls a bit, guys coming in and out asking them to go to the dance floor in the other room,</p><p class="hidden-text">many of them leading by asking if they want a drink.</p>
    <p> After a long enough time catching up in the kitchen the ring leader calls out, “OKAY we have to go dance now, they are actually playing good music all of a sudden!” and with these words, you’re whisked away into the living room to</p>

You grip your drink close so as not to let any spill out,</p><p class="hidden-text"> or any unwanted things in.</p><p>After finding your way to the center of the crowd, you look up to realize you’ve lost your friends. You shrug it off and start dancing your cares away. After a while of bumping into each other, people spilling drinks, and sweating your alcohol off, you decide to head to a wall to lean on.</p></div>

    <p>You couldn’t find any water when you were in the kitchen before, and the last thing you wanna do is drink from the sink water. You notice a guy with fresh bottled water in his hand and ask where he got it. “Oh it’s somewhere upstairs, there’s some cooler with bottled water in it” and so you head to the stairs. You go get your bottled water and as you head back down notice a woman on the steps.</p>
    <p class="hidden-text"> She’s completely passed out, clearly drank too much, and out of her head. Small groups of men and women stand at a distance whispering and giggling about the scene.</p><p>You push through trying to find your friends but are also hesitant about the girl.</p>
    <p class="hidden-text">One man whispers, “Someone can’t handle their liquor” with a giggle.</p><p>You realize one of these bystanders is Chad, who quickly puts his arm around your shoulder again. “Hey! We’re gonna do keg stands in the backyard and you teaming with me for this!” As Chad pulls you towards the backyard you look back again worried. And wonder if you should</p>

    <p class="hidden-text">They laugh, so clearly at the girl, and you feel embarrassed for being worried, who knew you could feel bad for being worried?</p><p>But you can’t shake the feeling.
